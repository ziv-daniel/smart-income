      <!-- ===== Payoneer ===== -->
      <div class="content-section" id="payoneer">
        <h2>Payoneer</h2>
        <p>Payoneer is especially popular among freelancers, remote workers, and small businesses. If you receive payments from international clients through platforms like Fiverr or Upwork, Payoneer integrates directly with those marketplaces.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Popular for freelancers and businesses</strong> &mdash; built for receiving international payments</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-currency receiving accounts</strong> &mdash; get paid in USD, EUR, GBP, and more</li>

      <div class="content-section" id="paypal">
        <h2>PayPal</h2>
        <p>PayPal is widely recognized and accepted, making it convenient for quick transfers. However, their exchange rates include a significant markup (around 3.5%), which makes it one of the more expensive options for regular international transfers.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Widely accepted</strong> &mdash; most people already have a PayPal account</li>
          <li><strong>Instant for PayPal-to-PayPal</strong> transfers (though withdrawal takes longer)</li>

        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- ===== Western Union ===== -->
      <div class="content-section" id="western-union">
        <h2>Western Union</h2>
        <p>Western Union is one of the oldest money transfer services. Its main advantage in Israel is the cash pickup option, available at post offices and agent locations across the country. This can be useful if the recipient does not have an Israeli bank account.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cash pickup option</strong> at post offices and agent locations throughout Israel</li>
          <li><strong>Moderate fees</strong> &mdash; varies by send/receive method and corridor</li>
          <li>Multiple send options: online, app, or in-person at agent locations</li>

      </div>

      <!-- ===== Bank Wire Transfer ===== -->
      <div class="content-section" id="bank-transfer">
        <h2>Bank Wire Transfer</h2>
        <p>The traditional bank wire is the method most people default to, but it is also the most expensive. Banks typically charge $25-50 per international wire, and their exchange rates include a 3-4% markup over the mid-market rate. For a $5,000 transfer, this can mean losing $200 or more compared to using Wise.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Traditional method</strong> &mdash; available at any bank with international wire capability</li>
          <li><strong>Highest fees</strong> &mdash; $25-50 per transfer (sender side), plus possible intermediary and receiving bank fees</li>
          <li><strong>Worst exchange rates</strong> &mdash; banks typically add a 3-4% markup over the mid-market rate</li>

        <h2>Tips for Sending Money to Israel</h2>
        <p>Practical advice to help you save money and avoid common pitfalls when transferring funds internationally.</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Always compare the total cost (fee + exchange rate markup).</strong> A provider with "zero fees" might hide the cost in a poor exchange rate. The calculator above shows the real amount you receive, which is what matters.</li>
          <li><strong>For regular transfers, set up recurring transfers with Wise.</strong> If you send money monthly (e.g., supporting family, paying rent, or topping up your Israeli account), Wise lets you automate recurring transfers at the best available rate.</li>
          <li><strong>For large transfers (buying property), get a quote from multiple providers.</strong> When sending $50,000+ for a real estate purchase, even a 0.5% difference in exchange rate is worth hundreds of dollars. Contact providers directly for large-amount pricing.</li>
          <li><strong>Timing matters: exchange rates fluctuate, consider rate alerts.</strong> The USD/ILS rate can swing 2-3% in a month. Use Wise or XE rate alerts to notify you when the rate hits your target, then send at the right moment.</li>
          <li><strong>For new olim: Nefesh B'Nefesh has partnerships with some providers.</strong> If you are making Aliyah, check with Nefesh B'Nefesh for special deals and guidance on transferring your savings to Israel.</li>

  <!-- ===== FAQ Section ===== -->
  <section class="section section-alt">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>What is the cheapest way to send money to Israel?</h3>
        <p>For most amounts, <strong>Wise</strong> is the cheapest option. They use the real mid-market exchange rate with no hidden markup, and their fees average around 0.55%. For a $1,000 transfer, you will typically save $30-60 compared to a bank wire. Use the calculator above to compare your specific amount.</p>

        <h3>How long does an international transfer take?</h3>
        <p>It depends on the provider and payment method. <strong>Wise</strong> typically takes 1-2 business days. <strong>Payoneer</strong> withdrawals to an Israeli bank account take 2-5 business days. <strong>Bank wire transfers</strong> are the slowest at 3-5 business days, sometimes longer if intermediary banks are involved. <strong>Western Union</strong> cash pickups can be available within minutes.</p>

        <h3>Do I need an Israeli bank account?</h3>
        <p>For most transfer services (Wise, Payoneer, bank wires), the recipient needs an Israeli bank account to receive the funds. <strong>Western Union</strong> is the exception &mdash; it offers cash pickup at post offices and agent locations, so no bank account is needed. If you are new to Israel, opening a bank account at Bank Leumi, Bank Hapoalim, or Discount Bank is straightforward with your Teudat Zehut (ID card).</p>

        <h3>What exchange rate will I get?</h3>
        <p>The exchange rate depends on the provider. <strong>Wise</strong> gives you the real mid-market rate (the one you see on Google or XE.com) with no markup. Most other providers add a markup of 1-4% on top of the mid-market rate. <strong>Banks are the worst</strong>, typically adding 3-4% markup. Always check the rate you are getting against the mid-market rate on Google to see the real cost.</p>
