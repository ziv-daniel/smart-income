      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>SmartHomeIL is Israel's first English-language smart home and tech comparison site, built specifically for the English-speaking community living in Israel. Whether you are a new oleh, a long-time resident, or an expat, navigating the Israeli tech landscape in English can be challenging. That is exactly why SmartHomeIL exists.</p>
      <p>Built by a full-stack developer and smart home enthusiast based in Israel, every piece of content on this site comes from hands-on experience. We do not just list specs from manufacturer websites. We buy, install, and test products in a real Israeli home with 220V electrical standards.</p>
      <p>Our mission is simple: help English-speaking residents of Israel make smart technology decisions with confidence. From choosing the right Zigbee switch that fits inside an Israeli junction box, to understanding your salary payslip, to finding the best way to transfer money internationally, we have you covered.</p>
      <p>SmartHomeIL uses <strong>Home Assistant</strong> as the primary smart home platform reference. We believe in local control, privacy, and open-source solutions that give you full ownership of your smart home, without relying on cloud services that may not have Israeli servers.</p>

  <!-- ===== How We Test Section ===== -->
  <section class="content-section section-alt">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>How We Test</h2>
      <p>Every product featured on SmartHomeIL goes through a rigorous evaluation process tailored specifically for the Israeli market. We do not rely on manufacturer claims alone.</p>

      <h3>Evaluation Criteria</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>220V Compatibility</strong> - Every device is verified to work safely with Israel's 220V / 50Hz electrical system. No guesswork, no assumptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Home Assistant Integration</strong> - We test each product for native or community-supported integration with Home Assistant, ensuring local control and automation capabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Protocol Support</strong> - Products are evaluated for ZigBee, WiFi, and Matter protocol support, with a preference for local protocols that do not depend on cloud connectivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Availability in Israel</strong> - We verify that recommended products are readily available through AliExpress, Amazon (with reasonable shipping to Israel), or local Israeli stores.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Rating Criteria</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ease of Setup</strong> - How straightforward is it to install and configure the device, especially for someone new to smart home technology?</li>
        <li><strong>Reliability</strong> - Does the device maintain a stable connection and perform consistently over weeks and months of daily use?</li>
        <li><strong>Smart Home Integration</strong> - How well does the device work within a broader Home Assistant ecosystem, including automations, dashboards, and scenes?</li>
        <li><strong>Value for Money</strong> - Considering Israeli pricing, import duties, and shipping costs, does the product deliver good value compared to alternatives?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All comparisons and reviews are updated regularly to reflect firmware updates, price changes, and new product releases. We clearly mark the date of last update on every review.</p>
